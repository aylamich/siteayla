# ☁️ My Digital Place ☁️

💙 Welcome to my personal website — a gentle blend of a minimal portfolio and a cozy space to share a piece of me.  
No heavy info, nothing too formal… just something cute, light, and cozy.

💡 **About this project**  
- Built to explore and play with the ICP blockchain (Internet Computer Protocol).  
- A simple, friendly, and more personal than professional website.  
- Crafted with care to be minimalistic, cute, and straight to the point. 🌀

🚀 **Tech stack**  
- **ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)** – hosting the site directly on the blockchain.  
- **React and Tailwind** – keeping it light and breezy.

☁️ **Deployment**  
The site is live on the ICP mainnet 🌠  
No setup needed — just click the link, and it’s there, straight from the blockchain.

💌 **Final note**  
This project started as a learning exercise and turned into my little website, now live on the web. I hope you enjoy it!
